Traffic Light Signal Simulation using MATLAB M-Scripting, Simulink API, and Stateflow
Developed a fully automated Traffic Light Control System using MATLAB M-scripting, Simulink API, and Stateflow, showcasing proficiency in programmatic model creation and simulation control.

Programmatically built a Stateflow chart with parent-child state hierarchy, incorporating entry, during, and exit actions to represent traffic light sequencing.

Implemented guarded transitions ([x >= 10], [x <= 0]) and configured default transitions using Stateflow APIs to emulate logical flow of real-world signal systems.

Utilized Stateflow Data API for variable declaration and signal management, enabling dynamic behavior of control logic during runtime.

Automated the creation and connection of Simulink blocks (e.g., Scope), and managed layout using Simulink diagram arrangement functions.

Scripted simulation parameters such as fixed-step solver, step size, and simulation time, achieving a fully script-driven and reproducible model setup.

Gained practical expertise in state machine development, embedded system logic, and model-based design (MBD) for automotive and industrial control systems.
