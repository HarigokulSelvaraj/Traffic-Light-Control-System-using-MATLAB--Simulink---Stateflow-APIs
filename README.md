Traffic Light Signal Simulation using MATLAB M-Scripting, Simulink API, and Stateflow

●	Designed and implemented a Traffic Light Signal Control System using Stateflow, MATLAB M-scripting, and Simulink API, demonstrating programmatic model generation and dynamic state transition control.

●	Created and configured the Stateflow chart programmatically with parent and child states, entry/during actions, and conditional transitions to emulate traffic light logic.

●	Defined transitions using logical guard conditions ([x >= 10], [x <= 0]) and set default transitions for initial state activation through APIs.

●	Utilized Stateflow Data API to declare and manage variables (e.g., x) and control signal behavior during simulation.

●	Automated Simulink model creation, block addition (Scope), line connections, and layout arrangement using Simulink API functions.

●	Set up simulation parameters like solver type, step size, and simulation time through scripting, achieving full automation of the model setup.

●	Acquired strong expertise in state machine modeling, embedded logic control, and Simulink-Stateflow integration aligned with automotive software development workflows.
